### Constant objects and function helps to maintain data integrity and enforce data immutability

# Constant Objects

A constatn object is an instant of a class that is declared with the const keyword .
Once aan object is made constatn its data member cannot be modified after object is created

const Class_name obj ;

- When you declare an object as const, you are essentailly telling the compiler that the object shoudl not change its state once it is initialzed. This enforces immutability and gurantees that the object is read-onlt throughout its lifetime

- Only constructor can initialize the data member variables of constant object.
  The data member of constant objects can be read only and any efforts to alter
  values of teh variables will generate an error.

- const object can only invoke constant functins else error will be generated

### Constant member function

A constant member function is a member function that cannot modify any data members of the class . You declare a member function as constant by appneding the const keyword at the end of functions's declaration

void functionName() const;

- constant member functions are critical when working with constant objects because they are the only functions that can be called ona const object. These function gurantee that they won;t change the object's internal state

- Constant member functions cannot modify any data members of the object, and they cannot call non-constant member functions.

# Why Do We Need Constant Member Functions?

- Ensures Safety: By using const functions, you guarantee that certain functions won’t alter the state of the object, which is especially useful in complex systems where accidental modification can cause bugs.
- Const-correctness: It’s important in C++ to be “const-correct,” meaning that functions that are logically read-only should be declared as const to prevent unintended modifications.

# Relation between Constant Objects and constant member functions

1 Constant objects
A constant object is an instance of a class that is declared witht eh const keyword . This mean that the object itself is read-only and cannot be modified after it has been created . Only constructor can initialize the values of constant objects

const Classname obj ;

A constant object can only call constant member functions and cannot call other functions

@ Constant member functons
A constant member functiosn is a function that cannot modify ant data membes of the calss or call non-constant member functions. You declare a member function as constant by appending the const keyword at the end of functions' s declaration

viod functionName() const;

A constant member functions ensures that it willn ot alter the object's internal state

## Relation

- constant objects can onlly call constant member functions .
- if you try to call a non-constant member function from a constant object, an error will be generated

Why is This Important?
Const-correctness: It ensures that functions that logically shouldn’t modify an object (e.g., functions that only read or display data) are explicitly marked as const. This protects the object from unintentional changes.
Data Integrity: Constant member functions maintain the integrity of constant objects by not allowing them to be modified.
Optimization: The compiler can optimize code knowing certain objects or member functions are const, which might improve performance in certain scenarios. 4. Why Use Constant Member Functions with Constant Objects?
Preserve Object State: If you have an object that represents some fixed data (like a configuration object), you may want to ensure that once it's created, nothing can modify its state. By marking it as const, and only allowing constant member functions, you guarantee that the object is immutable after creation.

Guarantee Read-Only Access: Constant member functions are ideal for operations that only need to read data from the object but don’t need to change anything (e.g., getters or display functions). This way, constant objects can safely call them without risking any changes.

Const-correctness Across Codebase: Const-correctness makes your codebase safer, more predictable, and easier to maintain by enforcing the separation of read-only and read-write operations.

Summary: The Key Relationship
Constant objects can only call constant member functions because constant member functions promise not to modify the object’s state.
Constant member functions are needed to ensure that read-only objects (constant objects) have safe access to functions without risking modification of their internal data.
This ensures const-correctness, data integrity, and improves code safety by preventing unintended modifications to objects when they are not supposed to change.
