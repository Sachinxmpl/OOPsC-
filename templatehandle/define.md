# Generic programming 
Generic programming is about generalizing software components so that they can be easily reused in a wide varitey of situations 

-  →Generic programming is a style of computer programming in
which algorithms are written in terms of types to-bespecified-later that are then instantiated when needed for
specific types provided as parameter

- → In C++, class and function templates are particularly effective
mechanisms for generic programming because they make the
generalization possible without sacrificing efficiency.
