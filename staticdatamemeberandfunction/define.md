### We create static data member o class because wen a data member is declared as static only one copy of the data memeber is maintained for all the objects . All objects have only one copy of static data member . So static data members are also known as class variables 

They are also known as class varaibles 


Also static function to get access to private static varaibles 


Static data member (also called a class varaible) is a varaible that is shared by all object of a class . There is only one copt of the static data member , regardless of how mant objects of a class are created 


### Characteristics 
- They are class varaible and hence can exist independently without an instance of object even if no objects are created 
- All instances of a class ie obbjects share smae static data member 
- Static data member must be initailized or simply defined outside the class 
- int Test::balance ;
